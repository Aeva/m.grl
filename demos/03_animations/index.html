    <p>
      The Midnight Graphics and Recreation Library is able to import
      .gani files and use them to facilitate keyframe animations.
      While it is not demonstrated in this demo, the playback of sound
      effects feature of .gani files is supported by MGRL.  The brief
      flash of red circles is the placeholder graphic that shows in
      place of undownloaded sprites.  This allows the download of a
      new sprite to not interrupt the playback of the animation.
      Sprites can be pre-cached to avoid this.

      If you're still confused, right-click on one of the animations
      below, and select "view background image".  This will show
      whichever sprite sheet instead of an animated gif.  Also, you
      can look at the links below the animations to see all of the
      files loaded up by the animation system.
