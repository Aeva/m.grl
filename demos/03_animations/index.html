    <h1>Sprite Animation Demo</h1>

    <p>
      The Mondaux Graphics and Recreation Library is able to import
      .gani files and use them to facilitate keyframe animations.
      While it is not demonstrated in this demo, the playback of sound
      effects feature of .gani files is supported by MGRL.
