    // First, lets define a camera.  In this demo, the camera is going

    // In the above lines, we set the camera's up_vector to [0, 1, 0].
    // What this does is makes it so that your screen's width
    // represents the X axis, the screens height represents the Y
    // axis, and then the Z axis is used to determine which sprites
    // overlap which other sprites.  The camera's location is set to
    // [0, 0, 100] and the look_at is set to [0, 0, 0] so that sprites
    // with a Z less than 100 appear infront of the camera.  If you
    // wanted to have the rendering be centered on say (5, -10)
    // instead of (0, 0), then the look_at value would be set to
    // [5, -10, 0] and the location would be set to [5, -10, 100].
    //
    // Note that the above coordinates are not in pixel units, and do
    // not need to be whole numbers.  One unit is equal to 32 pixels.
    // The camera's dpi property controls the grid size, however
    // changing the grid size may be broken at the time of writing
    // this demo.
    //
    // The set_orthographic method is called so as to not render
    // things with perspective, so that objects will be the same size
    // no matter where they are drawn on screen.

    
    // The default value for the camera's DPI is 32, so this line is
    // redundant, but you can change it to something else.  This maps
    // GL units to pixels.  This is only used for orthographic
    // rendering.  This does not effect the scale of objects on
    // screen, only their relative placement.  So for example, if you
    // wanted to place everything in absolute pixel coordinates, you'd
    // set this to one.
    camera.dpi = 32;

    
    // Last thing needed for the camera is to add it to the graph and
    // activate it.  Activation is only needed when using more than

    // is activated by default, but it is good to be explicit.

    // Ok next lets draw an image object somewhere.  For reference,
    // the image is 512 pixels by 256 pixels, so it would be 16 units
    // by 8 units.  Lets draw two of these such that they form a
    // square.  The location value of sprites created in this way is
    // the location of the bottom left corner of the sprite.  In the
