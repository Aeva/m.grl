 version zero - stab three

 Because we're all in this together, I have decided to dedicate M.GRL
 to the public domain by way of CC0.  You are free to do what you will
 with this code - I will pass no judgement upon you.

 See http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ for more info.

 Have a nice day!

 The Mondaux Graphics & Recreation Library (m.grl) is a cargo-code
 style javascript "library" for writing simple game demos.

 Some basic features:
 - asset management
 - gani-compatible sprite animation system
 - keyboard input handling that makes sense for games

 Things the future might hold:
 - various different types of game engines, 2D and 3D

 The kind of games kept in mind for this: 
 - retrotastic rpg short story "art games".  Keep your expectations
 low :)

 "Mondaux" is pronounced like "monday".  Bad faux-french.

 As for "m.grl", think "riot grrl" or "perl grrl".  Only its
 javascript instead.
