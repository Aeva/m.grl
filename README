 The Mondaux Graphics & Recreation Library (m.grl) javascript
 framework for writing games.

 Some basic features:
 - 2D and 3D rendering via WebGL
 - export from Blender
 - skeletal mesh animation (soon!)
 - gani-compatible sprite animation system
 - keyboard input handling that makes sense for games
.


 "Mondaux" is pronounced like "monday".  Bad faux-french.

 As for "m.grl", think "riot grrl" or "perl grrl".  Only its
 javascript instead.
