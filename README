 The Midnight Graphics & Recreation Library (m.grl) javascript
 framework for writing games.

 Some basic features:
 - 2D and 3D rendering via WebGL
 - export from Blender
 - skeletal mesh animation (soon!)
 - gani-compatible sprite animation system
 - keyboard input handling that makes sense for games
.


 Sphinx is used for documenting M.GRL.  If you make changes to the
 api, you will need to regenerate some of the documentation.

 Automatic generation of API documentation in Sphinx is accomplished
 with whisperdoc.  This tool can be installed from here:
 https://github.com/Aeva/whisperscope

 To regenerate the API pages, you can run this shell script:

$ sh update_docs.sh
.
