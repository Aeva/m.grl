 Sphinx is used for documenting M.GRL.  If you make changes to the

 Automatic generation of API documentation in Sphinx is accomplished
 with whisperdoc.  This tool can be installed from here:
 https://github.com/Aeva/whisperscope

 To regenerate the API pages, you can run this shell script:

$ sh update_docs.sh
.
