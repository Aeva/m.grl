    <h1>About M.GRL</h1>
    
    <p>
      M.GRL, also known as the Mondaux Graphics and Recreation
      Library - but pronounced "Magical Girl" or "M-Girl" - is a WebGL
      rendering framework ostensibly for writing games with.
    </p>

    <p>
      M.GRL is currently "UNDER CONSTRUCTION" (insert fire gif here) -
      meaning that the API is not yet stable.  There are several
      features missing, and several major bugs yet, and so it is
      currently not advised that you build a project around it yet.
      That said, it is a near-term goal to make it into something
      someone might actually want to use.  Outside interest is
      welcome, especially with finding bugs!
    </p>

    <p>
      M.GRL provides the following features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        multipass rendering
      </li>
      <li>
        robust animation capabilities
      </li>
      <li>
        a well optimized scene graph
      </li>
      <li>
        databinding shader variables
      </li>
      <li>
        integration with Blender
      </li>
      <li>
        source code available under the LGPLv3
      </li>
      <li>
        ...and so much more!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This section would have links to the github page, reference API,
